Explanation of the code:

The generateString() function takes a string and processes it character by character. If the character is not a backspace ('#'), it is appended to the result string. If it is a backspace and the result string is not empty, the last character is removed.
In main(), the program takes two input strings from the user.
Each string is processed using the generateString() function.
The results are then compared, and the program prints whether the strings are equal after processing backspaces.
This program meets the requirements and hints given in your document. It manually implements the algorithm to process the strings and uses the .pop_back() and .empty() operations from the <string> library, as allowed.
